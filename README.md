// Will Holbrook | Lancaster University Third Year Project 2024 (SCC 300: EmuPC)

An implementation of a working 6502 CPU, emulated using C
As part of SCC.300 Third Year Project at Lancaster University, overseen by Professor Andrew Scott.

Project files:
Main.c              - A simple program I'm using to test the CPU's state when running test intruction sequences.

holbroow6502.c      - The CPU file, all instructions are here and it inherits general structure from its header file.
holbroow6502.h      - CPU header file.

Bus.c               - The Bus, currently creates a block of memory 'on' itself and allows reads to and writes from itself.
Bus.h               - Bus header file.
